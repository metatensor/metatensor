# This file is here to serve as a minimal CMakeLists.txt at the root of the
# metatensor repository, allowing to easily include it inside other projects as
# a git submodule (or more generally as a CMake subdirectory).
#
# metatensor-core is always built, and additional options control building the
# other languages bindings:
#
# - `BUILD_METATENSOR_TORCH` to build the TorchScript bindings
