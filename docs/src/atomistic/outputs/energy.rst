.. _energy-output:

Energy
^^^^^^

Energy is associated with the ``"energy"`` key in the model outputs, and must
have the following metadata:

.. list-table:: Metadata for energy output
  :widths: 2 3 7
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metadata
    - Names
    - Description

  * - keys
    - ``"_"``
    - the energy keys must have a single dimension named ``"_"``, with a single
      entry set to ``0``. The energy is always a
      :py:class:`metatensor.torch.TensorMap` with a single block.

  * - samples
    - ``["system", "atom"]`` or ``["system"]``
    - if doing ``per_atom`` output, the sample names must be ``["system",
      "atom"]``, otherwise the sample names must be ``["system"]``.

      ``"system"`` must range from 0 to the number of systems given as input to
      the model. ``"atom"`` must range between 0 and the number of
      atoms/particles in the corresponding system. If ``selected_atoms`` is
      provided, then only the selected atoms for each system should be part of
      the samples.

  * - components
    -
    - the energy must not have any components

  * - properties
    - ``"energy"``
    - the energy must have a single property dimension named ``"energy"``, with
      a single entry set to ``0``.

The following simulation engines can use the ``"energy"`` output:

.. grid:: 1 3 3 3

  .. grid-item-card::
    :text-align: center
    :padding: 1
    :link: engine-lammps
    :link-type: ref

    :link-type: ref

  .. grid-item-card::

.. _energy-output-gradients:

Energy gradients
----------------

Most of the time when writing an atomistic model compatible with metatensor,
gradients will be handled implicitly and computed by the simulation engine using
a backward pass. Additionally, it is possible for the model to support explicit,
forward mode gradients

The following gradients can be defined and requested with
``explicit_gradients``:

- **"positions"** (:math:`r_j`) gradients will contain the negative of the
  forces :math:`F_j`.

  .. math::

      \frac{\partial E}{\partial r_j} = -F_j

.. list-table:: Metadata for positions energy's gradients
  :widths: 2 3 7
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metadata
    - Names
    - Description

  * - samples
    - ``["sample", "system", "atom"]``
    - ``"sample"`` indicates which of the values samples we are taking the
      gradient of, and ``("system", "atom")`` indicates which of the atom's
      positions we are taking the gradients with respect to; i.e. :math:`j` in
      the equation above.

  * - components
    - ``"xyz"``
    - there must be a single component named ``"xyz"`` with values 0, 1, 2;
      indicating the direction of the displacement of the atom in the gradient
      samples.

- **"strain"** (:math:`\epsilon`) gradients will contain the stress
  :math:`\sigma` acting on the system, multiplied by the volume :math:`V`
  (sometimes also called the *virial* of this system)

  .. math::

    \frac{\partial E}{\partial \epsilon} = V \sigma

.. list-table:: Metadata for strain energy's gradients
  :widths: 2 3 7
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metadata
    - Names
    - Description

  * - **samples**
    - ``"sample"``
    - There is a single gradient sample dimension, ``"sample"`` indicating which
      of the values samples we are taking the gradient of.

  * - **components**
    - ``["xyz_1", "xyz_2"]``
    - Both ``"xyz_1"`` and ``"xyz_2"`` have values ``[0, 1, 2]``, and correspond
      to the two axes of the 3x3 strain matrix :math:`\epsilon`.

.. _energy-ensemble-output:

Energy ensemble
---------------

An ensemble of energies is associated with the ``"energy_ensemble"`` key in the
model outputs. Such ensembles are sometimes used to perform uncertainty
quantification, using multiple prediction to estimate an error on the mean
prediction.

Energy ensembles must have the following metadata:

.. list-table:: Metadata for energy ensemble output
  :widths: 2 3 7
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metadata
    - Names
    - Description

  * - keys
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - samples
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - components
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - properties
    - ``"energy"``
    - the energy ensemble must have a single property dimension named
      ``"energy"``, with entries ranging from 0 to the number of members of the
      ensemble minus one.

The following simulation engines can use the ``"energy_ensemble"`` output:

.. grid:: 1 1 1 1

  .. grid-item-card::
    :text-align: center
    :padding: 1
    :link: engine-ipi
    :link-type: ref

Energy ensemble gradients
-------------------------

The gradient metadata for energy ensemble is the same as for the ``energy``
output (see :ref:`energy-output-gradients`).

.. _energy-uncertainty-output:

Energy uncertainty
------------------

The ``"energy_uncertainty"`` key in the model outputs is associated with the uncertainty on
the ``energy``, corresponding to the expected standard deviation of the predictions when
compared to the ground truth.

The energy uncertainty must have the following metadata:

.. list-table:: Metadata for energy uncertainty output
  :widths: 2 3 7
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metadata
    - Names
    - Description

  * - keys
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - samples
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - components
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

  * - properties
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`
    - same as :ref:`energy-output`

Currently, no simulation engines can use the ``"energy_uncertainty`` output.
