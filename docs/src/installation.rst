Installation
============

Metatensor is available for multiple programming languages, and how to install
and use it will depend on the programming language you are using.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Python
        :name: install-python

        Metatensor is split into multiple Python packages, each providing a
        subset of the functionality in a modular way. Most users will want to
        install all the packages, but installing individual packages is also
        supported.

        The simplest way to install metatensor is to use `pip`_, and run the
        following commands:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # Make sure you are using the latest version of pip
            pip install --upgrade pip

            pip install metatensor


        This will install the ``metatensor`` package, as well as
        ``metatensor-core``, ``metatensor-operations`` and ``metatensor-learn``.
        We provide pre-built version of ``metatensor-core`` for Linux (x64),
        Windows (x64) and macOS (x64 and ARM64). The other packages are pure
        Python package that should install on any operating system.

        You can install any of these sub-packages one by one with

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install metatensor-core
            pip install metatensor-operations
            pip install metatensor-learn

        **TorchScript integration**: If you also want to use the TorchScript
        bindings to metatensor, use this instead (see :ref:`this page
        <install-torch>` for more information).

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install metatensor[torch]

        **Conda**

        All the packages are also available on the `conda-forge
        <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel, however they are named slightly
        differently. The main packages are ``metatensor`` (which installs the
        Python packages ``metatensor-core``, ``metatensor-operations`` and
        ``metatensor-learn``); and ``metatensor-torch``, which installs all the
        previous packages as well as the ``metatensor-torch`` Python package.

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install -c conda-forge metatensor
            conda install -c conda-forge metatensor-torch

        If you want more control, the individual conda packages can also be
        installed with

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install -c conda-forge python-metatensor-core
            conda install -c conda-forge python-metatensor-operations
            conda install -c conda-forge python-metatensor-learn
            conda install -c conda-forge python-metatensor-torch


    .. tab-item:: C and C++
        :name: install-c

        The main classes of metatensor are available from C and C++, and can be
        installed as a C-compatible shared library, with a C++ header wrapping
        the C library with a modern C++ API. The installation also comes with
        the required files for `CMake`_ integration, allowing you to use
        metatensor in your own CMake project with ``find_package(metatensor)``.

        To build and install the code, you'll need to find the latest release of
        ``metatensor-core`` on `GitHub releases
        <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/releases>`_, and download the
        corresponding ``metatensor-core-cxx`` file in the release assets.

        You will also need to install a Rust compiler and ``cargo`` either with
        `rustup`_ or the package manager of your operating system. Then, you can
        run the following commands:

        .. code-block:: bash

            cmake -E tar xf metatensor-core-cxx-*.tar.gz
            cd metatensor-core-cxx-*
            mkdir build && cd build

            # configure cmake here if needed
            cmake ..

            # build and install the code
            cmake --build . --target install

        The build and installation can be configures with a few CMake options,
        using ``-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`` on the cmake command line, or one of the
        cmake GUI (``cmake-gui`` or ``ccmake``). Here are the main configuration
        options:

        +-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | Option                                    | Description                                   | Default        |

        +-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+

        **Conda**

        We also provide pre-compiled versions of the C and C++ libraries on the
        `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel. You can install these
        with

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install -c conda-forge libmetatensor



    .. tab-item:: Rust
        :name: install-rust

        To use metatensor from Rust, you can add following to your project
        ``Cargo.toml``

        .. code-block:: toml

            [dependencies]
            metatensor = "0.1"


        We have one feature that can be enabled with cargo: ``static``, which
        forces the code to use the static build of ``metatensor-core`` instead
        of a shared build. It is disabled by default. Enabling it will mean that
        your code might not be able to share data with other metatensor-enabled
        programs if they are using a different version of metatensor. For
        example if you are working on a Python extension with `PyO3
        <https://pyo3.rs/>`_, you should not use the ``static`` feature and
        instead have the code load the same shared library as the ``metatensor``
        Python package.


    .. tab-item:: TorchScript Python
        :name: install-torch

        The TorchScript bindings to metatensor are accessible in Python in the
        ``metatensor-torch`` package. You can install this at the same time you
        install the rest of metatensor with

        .. code-block:: bash

            # Make sure you are using the latest version of pip
            pip install --upgrade pip

            pip install metatensor[torch]

        or as a standalone package with

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install metatensor-torch

        We provide pre-compiled wheels on PyPI that are compatible with all the
        supported torch versions at the time of metatensor-torch release.
        Currently PyTorch version 2.1 and above is supported.

        If you want to use the code with an unsupported PyTorch version, or a
        new release of PyTorch which did not exist yet when we released
        metatensor-torch; you'll need to compile the code on your local machine
        with

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install metatensor-torch --no-binary=metatensor-torch

        This local compilation will require a couple of additional dependencies:

        - a modern C++ compiler, able to handle C++17, such as:
            - gcc version 7 or above;
            - clang version 5 or above;
            - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler, version 19 (2015) or above.
        - if you want to use the CUDA version of PyTorch, you'll also need the
          `CUDA toolkit <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_, including
          the NVIDIA compiler.

        By default, PyTorch is installed with CUDA support on Linux, even if you
        do not have a CUDA-compatible GPU, and will search for a CUDA toolkit
        when building extension (such as ``metatensor-torch``). If you don't
        want to install the CUDA toolkit in this case, you can use the CPU-only
        version of PyTorch with

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu metatensor-torch --no-binary=metatensor-torch

        A similar index URL can be used to install the ROCm (AMD GPU) version of
        PyTorch, please refer to the `corresponding documentation
        <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_.

        .. seealso::

            Some potential build failures and corresponding workarounds are
            listed at the end of the :ref:`install-torch-cxx` installation
            instructions.

        **Conda**

        You can install the same set of packages that ``pip install
        metatensor[torch]`` would using the `conda-forge
        <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel.

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install -c conda-forge metatensor-torch

        This will install ``python-metatensor-torch``,
        ``python-metatensor-operations`` and ``python-metatensor-learn``


    .. tab-item:: TorchScript C++
        :name: install-torch-cxx

        The TorchScript bindings to metatensor are also available as a C++
        library, which can be integrated in non-Python software (such as
        simulation engines) to use custom metatensor models directly in the
        software without relying on a Python interpreter. The code is installed
        as a shared library which register itself with torch when loaded, the
        corresponding header files and a CMake integration allowing you to use
        metatensor-torch in your code code with
        ``find_package(metatensor_torch)``.

        To build and install the code, you'll need to find the latest release of
        ``metatensor-torch`` on `GitHub releases
        <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/releases>`_, and download the
        corresponding ``metatensor-torch-cxx`` file in the release assets. Then,
        you can run the following commands:

        .. code-block:: bash

            cmake -E tar xf metatensor-torch-cxx-*.tar.gz
            cd metatensor-torch-cxx-*
            mkdir build && cd build

            # configure cmake here if needed
            cmake ..

            # build and install the code
            cmake --build . --target install

        You will have to to manually install some of the dependencies of
        metatensor-torch yourself to compile this code, and any of the
        dependencies is not in a standard location, specify the installation
        directory when configuring cmake with ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``. The
        following dependencies might have to be installed beforehand:

        - :ref:`the C++ interface <install-c>` of metatensor.
        - the C++ part of PyTorch, which you can install `on it's own
          <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_. We are compatible with
          libtorch version 2.1 or above. You can also use the same library as
          the Python version of torch by adding the output of the command below
          to ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``:

          .. code-block:: bash

              python -c "import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)"


        +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | Option                               | Description                                   | Default        |
        +======================================+===============================================+================+
        | ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``                 | Type of build: debug or release               | release        |
        +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``             | Prefix in which the library will be installed | ``/usr/local`` |
        +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``                | ``;``-separated list of path where CMake will |                |
        |                                      | search for dependencies. This list should     |                |
        |                                      | include the path to metatensor and torch      |                |
        +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------+

        **Workaround for some build errors**

        The CMake configuration used by libtorch sometimes fails to setup the
        build environment. You'll find here a list of some known build failures
        and how to workaround them.

        - .. code-block:: text

              Unknown CUDA Architecture Name 9.0a in CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS

          This can happen when building with a CUDA-enabled version of torch and
          a recent version of cmake. This issue is tracked at
          https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/113948. To work around it,
          you can ``export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.0 8.6 8.9 9.0"`` in your
          environment before building the code.

        - .. code-block:: text

              Imported target "torch" includes non-existent path
                [...]/MKL_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND"
              in its INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.

          This can happen when building for x86_64 Linux when MKL is not
          available on the current machine. Since MKL is a completely optional
          dependency, you can silence the error by running cmake with the
          ``-DMKL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include`` option.


        **Conda**

        We also provide pre-compiled versions of the library in the `conda-forge
        <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel. You can install it with

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install -c conda-forge libmetatensor-torch



Installing a development version
--------------------------------

Metatensor is developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor>`_.
If you want to install a development version of the code, you will need `git
<https://git-scm.com>`_ to fetch the latest version of the code. You will also
need a Rust compiler on top of any language specific compiler. You can install
Rust using `rustup`_ or the package manager of your operating system.


.. tab-set::
