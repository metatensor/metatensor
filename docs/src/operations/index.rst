Operations
==========

.. py:currentmodule:: metatensor

The Python API for metatensor also provides functions which operate on
:py:class:`TensorMap`, :py:class:`TensorBlock`, and :py:class:`Labels` and can
be used to build your own machine learning models. These operations are provided
in the ``metatensor-operations`` python package, which is installed by default
when doing ``pip install metatensor``.

The operations are implemented in Python, and handle the extra metadata
(including sparsity and gradients) of metatensor. Actual manipulations of the
data itself will call the corresponding functions from `numpy`_ or `PyTorch`_,
depending on how the arrays are stored in the various :py:class:`TensorBlock`.

.. _PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/

The list of all operations currently implemented is available in the API
reference below. If you need any other operation, please `open an issue
<https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor/issues>`_!
