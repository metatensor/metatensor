``metatensor`` is a library for defining, manipulating, storing, and sharing
arrays with many, potentially sparse, indices. Think numpy's ``ndarray`` or
PyTorch's ``Tensor`` with additional metadata and block-sparse storage.

``metatensor`` was designed to work with data in atomistic machine learning and
makes it easy, memory efficient, and fast to keep track of spherical harmonics
orders, neighboring atoms indices, atomic types, and much more. It can also
store gradients, keeping them together with the associated values.
