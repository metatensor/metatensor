An ``Array`` contains the actual data stored in a

This data is manipulated by ``metatensor`` in a completely opaque way: this
library does not know what's inside the arrays appart from a small set of
constrains:

- the array contains numeric data (loading and saving
  :py:class:`metatensor.TensorMap` additionally assumes arrays of 64-bit IEEE-754
  floating points numbers);
- they are stored as row-major, n-dimensional arrays with at least 2 dimensions;
- it is possible to create new arrays and move data from one array to another.

The actual type of an ``Array`` depends on how the
:py:class:`metatensor.TensorBlock` was created. Currently,
:py:class:`numpy.ndarray` and :py:class:`torch.Tensor` are supported.
