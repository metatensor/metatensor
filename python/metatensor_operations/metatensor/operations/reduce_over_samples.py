Reduction over samples
======================

These functions allow to reduce over the sample indices of a :py:class:`TensorMap` or
:py:class:`TensorBlock` objects, generating a new :py:class:`TensorMap` or
:py:class:`TensorBlock` in which the values sharing the same indices for the indicated
``sample_names`` have been combined in a single entry. The functions differ by the type
of reduction operation, but otherwise operate in the same way. The reduction operation
loops over the samples in each block/map, and combines all those that only differ by the
values of the indices associated with the names listed in the ``sample_names`` argument.
One way to see these operations is that the sample indices describe the non-zero entries
in a *sparse* array, and the reduction acts much like :func:`numpy.sum`, where
``sample_names`` plays the same role as the ``axis`` argument. Whenever gradients are
present, the reduction is performed also on the gradients.

See also :py:func:`metatensor.sum_over_samples_block` and
:py:func:`metatensor.sum_over_samples` for a detailed discussion with examples.
