            We provide a way to convert :py:class:`ase.Atoms` instances to
            :py:class:`System` using the :py:func:`systems_to_torch()` function.

            - `rascaline`_ has the :py:func:`rascaline.torch.systems_to_torch()`
              function that can convert from ASE, chemfiles and PySCF.
