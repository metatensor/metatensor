Handling sparsity
=================

The one sentence introduction to metatensor mentions that it is a
"self-describing **sparse** tensor data format". The :ref:`previous tutorial
<core-tutorial-first-steps>` explained the self-describing part of the format,
and in this tutorial we will explore what makes metatensor a sparse format; and
how to remove this sparsity when required.

Like in the :ref:`previous tutorial <core-tutorial-first-steps>`, we will load the data
we need from a file. The code used to generate this file can be found below:

.. details:: Show the code used to generate the :file:`radial-spectrum.mts` file

    ..

        The data was generated with `featomic`_, a package to compute atomistic
        representations for machine learning applications.

        .. _featomic: https://metatensor.github.io/featomic/latest/index.html

        .. literalinclude:: radial-spectrum.py.example
            :language: python

The file contains a representation of two molecules called the radial spectrum. The atom
:math:`i` is represented by the radial spectrum :math:`R_i^\alpha`, which is an
expansion of the neighbor density :math:`\rho_i^\alpha(r)` on a set of radial basis
functions :math:`f_n(r)`

.. math::

    R_i^\alpha(n) = \int f_n(r) \rho_i(r) dr

The density :math:`\rho_i^\alpha(r)` associated with all neighbors of species
:math:`\alpha` for the atom :math:`i` (where each neighbor is replaced with a
Gaussian function centered on the neighbor's coordinates :math:`g(r_{ij})`) is
defined as:

.. math::

    \rho_i^\alpha(r) = \sum_{j \in \text{ neighborhood of i }} g(r_{ij})
        \delta_{\alpha_j,\alpha}


The exact mathematical details above don't matter too much for this tutorial,
the main point being that this representation treats each atomic species as an
independent quantity, effectively using the neighboring species :math:`\alpha`
for `one-hot encoding`_.

# Sparsity in ``TensorMap``
# -------------------------
#
# The radial spectrum representation has two keys: ``central_species`` indicating the
# species of the central atom (atom :math:`i` in the equations); and
# ``neighbor_type`` indicating the species of the neighboring atoms (atom :math:`j`
# in the equations)

radial_spectrum = mts.load("radial-spectrum.mts")

print(radial_spectrum)

# %%
#
# This shows the first level of sparsity in ``TensorMap``: block sparsity.
#
# Out of all possible combinations of ``central_species`` and ``neighbor_type``, some
# are missing such as ``central_species=7, neighbor_type=8``. This is because we are
# using a spherical cutoff of 2.5 Å, and as such there are no oxygen neighbor atoms
# close enough to the nitrogen centers. This means that all the corresponding radial
# spectrum coefficients :math:`R_i^\alpha(n)` will be zero (since the neighbor density
# :math:`\rho_i^\alpha(r)` is zero everywhere).
#
# Instead of wasting memory by storing all of these zeros explicitly, we simply
# avoid creating the corresponding blocks from the get-go and save a lot of
# memory!


# %%
#
# Let's now look at the block containing the representation for oxygen centers and
# carbon neighbors:

block = radial_spectrum.block(center_type=8, neighbor_type=6)

# %%
#
# Naively, this block should contain samples for all oxygen atoms (since
# ``center_type=8``); in practice we only have a single sample!

print(block.samples)

# %%
#
# There is a second level of sparsity here, using a format related to the
# `coordinate sparse arrays (COO format) <COO_>`_. Since there is only one
# oxygen atom with carbon neighbors, we only include this atom in the samples,
# and the density/radial spectrum coefficient for all the other oxygen atoms is
# assumed to be zero.
#
# .. _COO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Coordinate_list_(COO)


# %%
#
# Making the data dense again
# ---------------------------
#
# Sometimes, we might have to use data in a sparse metatensor format with code
# that does not understands this sparsity pattern. One solution is to convert
# the data to a dense format, making the zeros explicit.
# Metatensor provides functionalities to convert sparse data to a dense format
# for the keys sparsity; and metadata to convert to a dense format for sample
# sparsity.
#
# First, the sample sparsity can be removed block by block by creating a new
# array full of zeros, and copying the data according to the indices in
# ``block.samples``

dense_block_data = np.zeros((len(atoms), block.values.shape[1]))

# only copy the non-zero data stored in the block
dense_block_data[block.samples["atom"]] = block.values

print(dense_block_data)


# %%
#
# Alternatively, we can undo the keys sparsity with
# :py:meth:`TensorMap.keys_to_samples` and :py:meth:`TensorMap.keys_to_properties`,
# which merge multiple blocks along the samples or properties dimensions respectively.
#
# Which one of these functions to call will depend on the data you are handling.
# Typically, one-hot encoding (the ``neighbor_types`` key here) should be merged
# along the properties dimension; and keys that define subsets of the samples
# (``center_type``) should be merged along the samples dimension.

dense_radial_spectrum = radial_spectrum.keys_to_samples("center_type")
dense_radial_spectrum = dense_radial_spectrum.keys_to_properties("neighbor_type")

# %%
#
# After calling these two functions, we now have a :py:class:`TensorMap` with a single
# block and no keys:

print(dense_radial_spectrum)

block = dense_radial_spectrum.block()

# %%
#
# We can see that the resulting dense data array contains a lot of zeros (and has a well
# defined block-sparse structure):

with np.printoptions(precision=3):
    print(block.values)

# %%
#
# By using the metadata attached to the block, we can understand which part of the data
# is zero and why. For example, the lower-right corner of the array corresponds to
# the nitrogen atoms (the last two samples):

print(block.samples.print(max_entries=-1))

# %%
#
# And these two bottom rows are zero everywhere, except in the part representing the
# nitrogen neighbor density:

print(block.properties.print(max_entries=-1))
