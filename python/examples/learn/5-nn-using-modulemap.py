Custom architectures with ``ModuleMap``
=======================================

.. py:currentmodule:: metatensor.torch.learn.nn

This tutorial demonstrates how to build custom architectures compatible with
``TensorMap`` objects by combining native ``torch.nn`` modules with metatensor-learn's
``ModuleMap``.

.. note::

    Prior to this tutorial, it is recommended to read the tutorial on :ref:`using
    convenience modules <learn-tutorial-nn-modules-basic>`, as this tutorial builds on
    the concepts introduced there.

#
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# The previous tutorials cover how to use metatensor learn's ``nn`` convenience modules
# to build simple multi-layer perceptrons and their equivariance-preserving analogs. Now
# we will explore the use of a special module called ``ModuleMap`` that allows users to
# wrap any native torch module to be compatible with a ``TensorMap``.
#
# This is useful for building arbitrary architectures containing layers more complex
# than found in the standard available layers: namely ``Linear``, ``Tanh``, ``ReLU``,
# ``SiLU`` and ``LayerNorm`` and their equivariant counterparts.
#
# First we need to create some dummy data in :py:class:`TensorMap` format, with multiple
# :py:class:`TensorBlock`. Here we will focus on unconstrained architectures, as opposed
# to equivariance preserving ones. The principles in the latter case will be similar, as
# long as care is taken to build architectures with equivarince-preserving
# transformations.
#
# Let's start by defining a random tensor that we will treat as some intermediate
# representation. We will build a multi-layer perceptron to transform this tensor into a
# prediction. Here we will define a 3-block tensor map, with variable in and out
# dimensions for each block.

#
# Starting simple
# ---------------
#
# Let's start with a simple linear layer, but this time constructed manually using
# ``ModuleMap``. Here we want a linear layer for each block, with the correct in and out
# feature sizes. The result will be a module that is equivalent to the
# ``metatensor.torch.learn.nn.Linear`` module.

#
# ``ModuleMap`` automatically handles the forward pass for each block indexed by the
# ``in_keys`` used to intialize it. In the case where the input contains more
# keys/blocks than what's given as ``in_keys`, the forward pass will only be applied to
# the blocks that are present in the input. The output will be a new ``TensorMap`` with
# the same keys as the input, with the correct output meatdata.

# %%
#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial we have seen how to build custom architectures using ``ModuleMap``.
# This allows for arbitrary architectures to be built, as long as the metadata is
# preserved. We have also seen how to build a custom module that wraps a ``ModuleMap``
# and adds residual connections.
#
# The key takeaway is that ``ModuleMap`` can be used to wrap any combination of native
# ``torch.nn`` modules to make them compatible with ``TensorMap``. In combination with
# convenience layers seen in the tutorial :ref:`nn modules basic
# <learn-tutorial-nn-modules-basic>`, and sparse-data operations from
# ``metatensor-operations``, complex architectures can be built with ease.
