#
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# Often the targets of machine learning are physical observables with certain
# symmetries, such as invariance with respect to translation or equivariance with
# respect to rotation (rotating the input structure means that the target should be
# rotated in the same way).
#
# Many successful approaches to these learning tasks use equivariance-preserving
# architectures to map equivariant features onto predictions of an equivariant target.
#
# In this example we will demonstrate how to build an equivariance-preserving
# multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on top of some equivariant features.
#
# Let's load the spherical expansion from the :ref:`first steps tutorial
# <core-tutorial-first-steps>`.
spherical_expansion = mts.load("../core/spherical-expansion.mts")

# metatensor-learn modules currently do not support TensorMaps with gradients
spherical_expansion = mts.remove_gradients(spherical_expansion)

print("\nNumber of blocks in the spherical expansion:", len(spherical_expansion))

# %%
#
# As a reminder, these are the coefficients of the spherical-basis decompositions of a
# smooth Gaussian density representation of 3D point cloud. In this case, the point
# cloud is a set of decorated atomic positions.
#
# The important part here is that these features are block sparse in angular momentum
# channel (key dimension ``"o3_lambda"``), with each block having a different behaviour
# under rigid rotation by the SO(3) group.
#
# In general, blocks that are invariant under rotation (where ``o3_lambda == 0``) can be
# transformed in arbitrary (i.e. nonlinear) ways in the mapping from features to target,
# while covariant blocks (where ``o3_lambda > 0``) must be transformed in a way that
# preserves the equivariance of the features. The simplest way to do this is to use only
# linear transformations for the latter.


# %%
#
# Define equivariant target data
# ------------------------------
#
# Let's build some dummy target data: we will predict a global (i.e. per-system) rank-2
# symmetric tensor, which decomposes into ``o3_lambda = [0, 2]`` angular momenta
# channels when expressed in the spherical basis. An example of such a target in
# atomistic machine learning is the electronic polarizability of a molecule.
#
# Our target will be block sparse with ``"o3_lambda"`` key dimensions equal to [0, 2],
# and as this is a real- (not pseudo-) tensor, the inversion sigma (``"o3_sigma"``) will
# be +1.
target_tensormap = TensorMap(
    keys=Labels(["o3_lambda", "o3_sigma"], torch.tensor([[0, 1], [2, 1]])),
    blocks=[
        TensorBlock(
            values=torch.randn((1, 1, 1), dtype=torch.float64),
            # only one system
            samples=Labels(["system"], torch.tensor([[0]])),
            # o3_mu = [0]
            components=[Labels(["o3_mu"], torch.tensor([[0]]))],
            # only one 'property' (the L=0 part of the polarizability)
            properties=Labels(["_"], torch.tensor([[0]])),
        ),
        TensorBlock(
            values=torch.randn((1, 5, 1), dtype=torch.float64),
            # only one system
            samples=Labels(["system"], torch.tensor([[0]])),
            # o3_mu = [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2]
            components=[Labels(["o3_mu"], torch.tensor([[-2], [-1], [0], [1], [2]]))],
            # only one 'property' (the L=2 part of the polarizability)
            properties=Labels(["_"], torch.tensor([[0]])),
        ),
    ],

#
# Filter the feature blocks to only keep the blocks with symmetries that match the
# target: as our target only contains ``o3_lambda = [0, 2]`` channels, we only need
# these!

    "\nNumber of blocks in the filtered spherical expansion:", len(spherical_expansion)

# %%
#
# Using equivariant convenience layers
# ------------------------------------
#
# Now we can build our neural network. Our architecture will consist of separate "block
# models", i.e. transformations with separate learnable weights for each block in the
# spherical expansion. This is in contrast to the previous tutorial :ref:`nn modules
# basic <learn-tutorial-nn-modules-basic>`, where we only had a single block in our
# features and targets.
#
# Furthermore, as the features are a per-atom quantity, we will use some sparse tensor
# operations to sum the contributions of all atoms in the system to give a per-sytem
# prediction. For this we will use ``metatensor-operations``.
#
# Starting simple, let's define the neural network as just a simple linear layer. As
# stated before, only linear transformations must be applied to covariant blocks, in
# this case those with ``o3_lambda = 2``, while nonlinear transformations can be applied
# to invariant blocks where ``o3_lambda = 0``. We will use the
# :py:class:`~metatensor.torch.learn.nn.EquivariantLinear` module for this.

#
# We can see by printing the archectecture of the ``EquivariantLinear`` module, that
# there are 8 'Linear' layers, one for each block. In order to preserve equivariance,
# bias is always turned off for all covariant blocks. For invariant blocks, bias can be
# switched on or off by passing the bool parameter ``bias`` when initializing
# ``EquivariantLinear``.

# Let's see what happens when we pass the features through the network.

#
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# This tutorial has demonstrated how to build equivariance-preserving architectures
# using the metatensor-learn convenience neural network modules. These modules, such as
# ``EquivariantLinear`` and ``InvariantReLU`` are modified analogs of the standard
# convenience layers, such as ``Linear`` and ``ReLU``.
#
# The key difference is that the invariant or covariant nature (via the "o3_lambda" key
# dimension) of the input blocks are taken into account, and used to determine the
# transformations applied to each block. For the convenience modules shown above
