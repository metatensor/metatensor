# The metatensor python package is distributed in multiple pieces, each with its own
# version number and dependency management:
#
# - the `metatensor-core` distribution contains the Python bindings to the
#   metatensor-core C API in the `metatensor` python package. External package
#   integrating with metatensor such as featomic only depend on metatensor-core.
# - the `metatensor-operations` distribution contains the operations to manipulate
#   metatensor data. Is is using Python's namespace packages
#   (https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) to install itself in `metatensor/operations`.
# - the `metatensor-torch` distribution contains the TorchScript bindings to the C API.
#   it installs itself in `metatensor/torch`.
#
# There is also a `metatensor` distribution which does not contain any package, and
# only declares dependencies on `metatensor-core` and `metatensor-operation`; as well
# an an optional dependency on `metatensor-torch`.
