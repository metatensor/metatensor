Required tools
--------------

You will need to install and get familiar with the following tools when working
on metatensor:

- **git**: the software we use for version control of the source code. See
  https://git-scm.com/downloads for installation instructions.
- **the rust compiler**: you will need both ``rustc`` (the compiler) and
  ``cargo`` (associated build tool). You can install both using `rustup`_, or
  use a version provided by your operating system. We need at least Rust version
  1.64 to build metatensor.
- **Python**: you can install ``Python`` and ``pip`` from your operating system.
  We require a Python version of at least 3.7.
- **tox**: a Python test runner, cf https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. You
  can install tox with ``pip install tox``.

Additionally, you will need to install the following software, but you should
not have to interact with them directly:

- **cmake**: we need a cmake version of at least 3.10.
- **a C++ compiler** we need a compiler supporting C++11. GCC >= 5, clang >= 3.7
  and MSVC >= 15 should all work, although MSVC is not yet tested continuously.

.. admonition:: Optional tools

  Depending on which part of the code you are working on, you might experience a
  lot of time spend re-compiling Rust or C++ code, even if you did not change
  them. If you'd like faster builds (and in turn faster tests), you can use
  `sccache`_ or the classic `ccache`_ to only re-run the compiler if the
  corresponding source code changed. To do this, you should install and configure
  one of these tools (we suggest sccache since it also supports Rust), and then
  configure cmake and cargo to use them by setting environnement variables. On
  Linux and macOS, you should set the following (look up how to do set environment
  variable with your shell):

  .. code-block:: bash

      CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache
      CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache
      # only if you have sccache and not ccache
      RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache


  .. _sccache: https://github.com/mozilla/sccache
  .. _ccache: https://ccache.dev/

Getting the code
----------------

The first step when developing metatensor is to `create a fork`_ of the main
repository on github, and then clone it locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone <insert/your/fork/url/here>
    cd metatensor

    # setup the local repository so that the master branch tracks changes in
    # the main repository
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/lab-cosmo/metatensor
    git fetch upstream
    git branch master --set-upstream-to=upstream/master

Once you get the code locally, you will want to run the tests to check
everything is working as intended. See the next section on this subject.

If everything is working, you can create your own branches to work on your
changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b <my-branch-name>
    # code code code

    # push your branch to your fork
    git push -u origin <my-branch-name>
    # follow the link in the message to open a pull request (PR)

.. _create a fork: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

Running tests
-------------

The continuous integration pipeline is based on `cargo`_. You can run all tests
with:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <path/to/metatensor/repo>
    cargo test  # or cargo test --release to run tests in release mode

These are exactly the same tests that will be performed online in our Github CI
workflows. You can also run only a subset of tests with one of these commands:

- ``cargo test`` runs everything
- ``cargo test --package=metatensor-core`` to run the C/C++ tests only;

  - ``cargo test --test=run-cxx-tests`` will run the unit tests for the C/C++
    API. If `valgrind`_ is installed, it will be used to check for memory
    errors. You can disable this by setting the `METATENSOR_DISABLE_VALGRIND`
    environment variable to 1 (`export METATENSOR_DISABLE_VALGRIND=1` for most
    Linux/macOS shells);
  - ``cargo test --test=check-cxx-install`` will build the C/C++ interfaces,
    install them and the associated CMake files and then try to build a basic
    project depending on this interface with CMake;

- ``cargo test --package=metatensor-torch`` to run the C++ TorchScript extension
  tests only;

  - ``cargo test --test=run-torch-tests`` will run the unit tests for the
    TorchScript C++ extension;
  - ``cargo test --test=check-cxx-install`` will build the C++ TorchScript
    extension, install it and then try to build a basic project depending on
    this extension with CMake;

- ``cargo test --package=metatensor-python`` (or ``tox`` directly, see below) to
  run Python tests only;
- ``cargo test --lib`` to run unit tests;
- ``cargo test --doc`` to run documentation tests;
- ``cargo bench --test`` compiles and run the benchmarks once, to quickly ensure
  they still work.

You can add some flags to any of above commands to further refine which tests
should run:

- ``--release`` to run tests in release mode (default is to run tests in debug mode)
- ``-- <filter>`` to only run tests whose name contains filter, for example ``cargo test -- keys_to_properties``

Also, you can run individual python tests using `tox`_ if you wish to run a
subset of Python tests, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e core-tests           # unit tests for metatensor-core
    tox -e operations-tests     # unit tests for metatensor-operations
    tox -e torch-tests          # unit tests for metatensor-torch
    tox -e docs-tests           # doctests (checking inline examples) for all packages
    tox -e lint                 # code style
    tox -e build-python         # python packaging

    tox -e format               # format all files

The last command ``tox -e format`` will use tox to do actual formatting instead
of just checking it, you can use to automatically fix some of the issues
detected by ``tox -e lint``.

You can run only a subset of the tests with ``tox -e tests -- <test/file.py>``,
replacing ``<test/file.py>`` with the path to the files you want to test, e.g.
``tox -e tests -- python/tests/operations/abs.py``.

When running the metatensor-torch unit tests, you might get an error about CUDA
not being available if you try to build the code against the default PyPI
version of PyTorch. A possible workaround is to use the CPU-only version of
PyTorch in the tests, by setting the ``PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`` environnement
variable to ``https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu``, for example in bash and
related shells:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    tox -e torch-tests
    # or
    cargo test

Contributing to the documentation
---------------------------------

The documentation of metatensor is written in reStructuredText (rst) and uses the
`sphinx`_ documentation generator. In order to modify the documentation, first
create a local version of the code on your machine as described above. Then, you
can build the documentation with:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e docs

You can then visualize the local documentation with your favorite browser with
the following command (or open the :file:`docs/build/html/index.html` file
manually).

.. code-block:: bash

    # on linux, depending on what package you have installed:
    xdg-open docs/build/html/index.html
    firefox docs/build/html/index.html

    # on macOS:
    open docs/build/html/index.html

Python doc strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our docstring format follows the `sphinx format`_ and a typical function doc string
looks like the following.

.. code-block:: python

    def func(value_1: float, value_2: int) -> float:
        r"""A one line summary sentence of the function.

        Extensive multi-line summary of what is going in. Use single
        backticks for parameters of the function like `width` and two ticks for
        values ``67``. You can link to classes :py:class:`metatensor.Labels`. This
        also works for other classes and functions like :py:obj:`True`.

        Inline Math is also possible with :math:`\mathsf{R}`. Or as a math block.

        .. math::

            \mathbf{x}' = \mathsf{R}\mathbf{x}


        :param value_1:
            The first parameter of the function, a :py:class:`float`.
        :param value_2:
            The second parameter of the function, an :py:class:`int`.

        :returns result:
            The result of the calculation, a :py:class:`float`.

        :raises TypeError:
            If `value_1` is not a :py:class:`float` or `value_2` is not a :py:class:`int`.
        :raises ValueError:
            If `value_1` is not greater than zero.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from metatensor import func
        >>> func(1, 1)
        42
        """
        ...
        return result

Guidelines for writing Python doc strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use Python typing in the function arguments, indicate return types.

* Start the description after each ``:param:`` or ``:return:`` in a new line and add an
  empty line between the parameter and return block.

* Emphasize function and class parameters with a single backtick i.e ```param``` and
  general variables should be double backticked . i.e. ````my_variable````

* If you include any maths, make the string a
  `raw string`_ by prefixing with ``r``, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: python

    r"""Some math like :math:`\nu^2 / \rho` with backslashes."""

  Otherwise the ``\n`` and ``\r`` will be rendered as ASCII escape sequences that break
  lines without you noticing it or you will get either one of the following two
  errors message

  1. `Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent`
  2. `Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end string`

* The examples are tested with `doctest`_. Therefore, please make sure that they are
  complete and functioning (with all required imports).
  Use the ``>>>`` syntax for inputs (followed by ``...`` for multiline inputs) and no
  indentation for outputs for the examples.

  .. code-block:: python

      """
      >>> a = np.array(
      ...    [1, 2, 3, 4]
      ... )
      """
